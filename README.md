#Reopening inactive repository

This is a repository that is based on the dnsjava svn repository. However the original
project is inactive and this repository allows patches to be openly available.

Currently, the only patch added to the code is per https://github.com/ibauersachs/dnssecjava/issues/14 to remove leading zeros in ECDSA signatures.

## Reporting issues and providing patches to the upstream project

Since the original project is inactive, pull requests are welcome. However we still recommend reporting patches to http://sourceforge.net/p/dnsjava/code/HEAD/tree/.

## Repository maintainance

The original source code is from http://sourceforge.net/p/dnsjava/code/HEAD/tree/
but will not be updated unless there is a new release.
